and some other dependencies that follows most projects.

Bugs: 
1. When opening the inspector and the console you will find warnings that apperared a couple of days ago (this line is written 2022-04-21). The app works but I will debug this so they don't appear.
2. A user cannot search in the searchbox for a city. That functionality is not available yet. However you can scroll and play with the Google Map and see new places appeare. 

####
To start the app write in the terminal "npm start".
Enjoy.
